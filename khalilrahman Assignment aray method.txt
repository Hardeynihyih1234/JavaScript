	Part I 
Write the code necessary to do the following: 
1. Create an empty array called arr.
 answer 
 arr=[]
 console.log(arr);
2. Add your first name to the arr variable 
 answer
let arr=[] 
arr[0]="Khalilrahman";
 console.log(arr);
3. Add your last name to the end of the arr variable
 answer
 let arr=['Khalilrahman']
arr.push("Adeniyi")
 console.log(arr);
  
4. Add your favorite color to the beginning of the arr variable 
 Answer
 let arr = ['Khalilrahman','Adeniyi']
arr.unshift("yellow")
 console.log(arr);

Your variable arr should look like this (using Elie for a first name, Schoppik for a last 
name and purple for a favorite color) ["purple", "Elie", "Schoppik"]. Keep going! 
5. Remove the favorite color from the in the array - arr
 variable (remember this is the first value what method can you use to remove the first value in an array?) 
 Answer
let arr=['yellow','Khalilrahman','Adeniyi'] 
arr.shift();
console.log(arr);			

6. Create another array called arr2.
Answer
arr2=[]
console.log(arr2); 
 
7. Add your favorite number to arr2 	 
Answer
arr2[0]=7;
console.log(arr2);
	 
8.Add the string "JavaScript" to the end of the arr2 variable 
Your variable arr2 should look like this (using 42 as a favorite number) [42, 
"JavaScript"].
 Answer
let arr2 =[7] 
arr2.push;("Javascript")
 console.log(arr2);

9. See if the value 42 exists in the arr2 array. Do this using the indexOf method. What does indexOf return
to you if the value passed to it can not be found in the array?
 Answer
10. Create a new variable called combinedArr which is the result of your arr and arr2 variables combined into one array.
Your combinedArr variable should look like this (using our previous values) ["Elie", "Schoppik", 42, "JavaScript"]
Answer
let combinedArr =["Khalilrahman","Adeniyi",7,"Javascript"]
 console.log(arr2)
                Part II
 Complete the following, starting from the following array: 
let arr = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby", "Java"]
 1. Return the following array: ["Python", "Ruby"].
  Answer
  let arr = ["JavaScript","Python", "Ruby", "Java"];
arr.splice(0,1);
arr.splice(2,1);
console.log(arr); 
 2. Combine the array with the array ["Haskell", "Clojure"].
 Answer
arr = ["JavaScript","Python", "Ruby", "Java"];
let combinedArr = arr.concat("Haskell", "Clojure");
console.log(combinedArr);

 3. Return the string "JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java".
 Answer
arr = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby", "Java"];
let arr2 = [arr.join(", ")];
console.log(arr2);

 4. Try to explain, in your own words (or diagrams!) what the difference is between passing by value vs. passing by reference
